answering the questions:

1.

How are the local AI processing capabilities implemented? Are there specific libraries or frameworks used for local inference?
 - all that is needed is an "inference endpoint" for the API. The endpoint should be OpenAI API compatible. As long as that is the case Taskyon can talk to the endpoint. Endpoints are configurable in the settings of taskyon in the frontend!
Hardware requirements depend on the AI

What are the hardware requirements or recommendations for running AI models locally?
 - about hardware requirements:  its possible to run qunatized 7B/12B models on laptops. But better graphciscards will help and this is also very slow. This is much better explained on other webpages... Otherwise you can always host your own LLM in the cloud. there is a lot of options out there now. E.g. huggingface with their text genration endpoint.

2. Security and Privacy:

Could you provide more details on the security measures within the sandboxed environments? How is user data isolated and protected?
 - data doesn't leave the browser
 - right now, the only data which leaves the browser is for inference. If the endpoint is private, full data protection is achieved.
 - if a "public" inference endpoint is chosen such as OpenAI, the chat history will be visible to them. But they will not see the execution of tools & functions. This stays only local. Additionally, Chat history is saved locally.
 - inside taskyon iframes & webworkers are used for isolation. Additionally, taskyons asks for explicit permission if foreign datasources are added to it.

How does Taskyon handle potential vulnerabilities in the local execution of code and AI models?
 - by encouraging local deployment and a label-based permission system which data an AI can access.

3. Service Integration:

What LLM providers are currently supported, and how does Taskyon manage switching between different providers?
 - providers supported are all which support OpenAI API compatible endpoints. Among them are
   [LocalAI](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI), [Huggingface Text Generation Inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/en/index), [Openrouter](https://openrouter.ai/), [Taskyon.space](taskyon.space).
 - These providers offer a broad collection of models and also route to ChatGPT, Gemini, Anthropic, Google, Meta with all their respective models.
 - Adding an API can be done in the frontend or by configuring taskyon with a json file. Or by directly configuring taskyon through an iframe when integrating it into a webpage.

Are there any plans to support more providers in the future or integrate additional types of services?
 - Yes, taskyon is activly being worked on. Whatever is integrated into taskyon will always follow the local first principles. This also means that taskyon will always be open source. Taskyon is meant to be a platform which can be adapted to different applications in a very flexible and modern way. Xyntopia uses taskyon for engineering applications and is developing tools for this.

4. Function Tasks:

Can you elaborate on the types of function tasks that can be executed? Are there predefined templates or examples?
 - Yes!  there is a template and instructions! go to this link [https://taskyon.space/tools](https://taskyon.space/tools). It rarely gets more complicated then filling out a few lines of a json file! You can even ask Taskyon to do this for you!

How flexible is the interface for creating and managing custom function tasks?
 - Everythig happens in the frontend. This makes execution of functions inherently a lot more scalable and secure.
 - this makes taskyon also very flexible. if run as a desktop app  functions have access to the local environment if given permission.
 - in the browser functions are restricted to what the browser allows, which automatically makes them run in a sandboxed environment. Making it again a lot more secure, than if they were run on your backend.
 - additionally, when integrating taskyon into an app, the declaration of functions happens *inside the app* not in taskyon. This limits function declaration only to what the app can offer.

5. Contextual Task Management:

How is the context attached to tasks managed and utilized? Are there specific formats or standards for attaching context like files or other tasks?
 - taskyon maintains a decentralized database of all chats and uploaded files. The database is stored in the browser, but can also be shared among teams in a p2p fashion. Additionally, the database can be stored on a MongoDB backend.
 - taskyon stores everything in a "tasktree" each node in the tree is a task with follow up & parent tasks. These tasks have a standardized format (TODO: link)

How does Taskyon ensure the relevance and accuracy of context in task execution?
 - taskyon vectorizes all tasks and stores them in a local vector store. This way it can choose the right context
 - additionally, taskyon tasks can be labeled. This gives user in taskyon more options to carefully select which context taskyon should be working in. It also helps to make sure which tasks should be allowed to share.

6. Frontend Capabilities:

How are the secure sandbox environments for Python and JavaScript code execution managed? Are there limitations to the code that can be run within these sandboxes?
 - First layer of security is that functions are run in the browser itself. So they are restricted to the context of the domain they're run and automatically sandboxed without access to the backend or server.
 - The second layer can be chosen by the user:  it can either be run inside the context of the domain, in an isolated webworker or an iframe. wich iframe being the most secure. All the browser restrictions on each environment apply.

Can you provide examples of the types of tools that can be generated on-the-fly using JavaScript or Python?
 - Tools right now are only JS-based. Py based tools are in development.
 - Python code can already be executed in taskyon though! It is based on [https://pyodide.org](https://pyodide.org)
 - We are working on more documentation right now, stay tuned. Some examples are:
   * Interacting with Google Maps and other apps.
   * Interfacing with Email accounts.
   * doing data analysis using python.
   * Act as a financial advisor by interacting with a wealth Management webpage.

7. Webpage Integration:

How can webpage owners integrate Taskyon into their sites? Are there specific scripts or APIs provided for this integration?
 - By including taskyon as an iframe. Taskyon does NOT require you to run any backend for AI! It can be *completly* configured from the html code of your app (E.g. pure js, ts, vue/react/svelte/angular  there are no restrictions on frameworks ).
 - example code is given here:  [https://taskyon.space/tools](https://taskyon.space/tools).
 - A webpage configures taskyon through the iframe. E.g. configure rate limits, and restrictions on which LLM to use.
 - A webpage declares functions/tools to taskyon which taskyon can then call when users interact with it. Through this
   mechamism taskyon can essentially interact with any part of the webpage.
 - Security is maintained through the browsers sandboxing mechanisms. Taskyon wil be run in its own context for every webpage which calls it in an iframe. This prevents X-site attacks.
 - taskyon only has access to the functions it was explicitly given access to.


Are there any security concerns or best practices for integrating Taskyon into external webpages?
 - check [https://taskyon.space/tools](https://taskyon.space/tools)
 - security concerns are the same as when you integrate an iframe into your webpage. In short:  everythig evreywhere is sandboxed and
   only explicit messages are exchanged between systems.

8. Enhanced Markdown Support:

What are some use cases for the enhanced markdown features like mermaid graphics, SVG drawings, and embedded HTML widgets?
 - generating flow charts, gantt diagrams and mindmaps
 - project management
 - generating reports
 - generating presentations
 - generate an html widget to let the user select between multiple choices.
 - provide answers and explanations with sophisticated math (e.g. use python sympy for calculation and then present the result)
   in a visual appealing way with correct math notation.

Are there any limitations or performance considerations when using these enhanced markdown features?
 - The limits are the capabilities of the LLMs right now. Some of them are not good enough yet to generate
   good mermaid code.

9. Vision Models:

Can you provide more information on the vision models integrated with Taskyon? What tasks or functionalities do they support?
Are there any examples or use cases demonstrating the capabilities of these vision models?
 - You can add images and models with multi-modal vision cabability can itnerprete those images. The quality depends on the model used.
   Best way is to simply try it out!

10. Roadmap:

Can you provide more details on the upcoming features like P2P task synchronization and autonomous agents? What are the expected benefits and use cases?
 - p2p task synchronization enables teams to work in the same context with AI. This enables teams to have project-based contexts and exchange information quickly between team members.

What is the timeline for the integration of local LLM inference and the release of the desktop app and container?
 - local LLM inference can already be used right now simply by using a local OpenAI API-compatible endpoint.
 - release of desktop app and container: container will be first, desktop second. Additionally, we will add a "static" version of taskyon for simply copy & paste onto any http-capable webserver. All of these versions are used in different projects at Xyntopia already.

11. Contribution Guidelines:

What are the specific areas where you need the most help from contributors?
 - bug reports
 - writing a library of standard tools
 - enhance UI experience

Are there any coding standards or guidelines that contributors should follow?
 - Taskyon provides standardized coding styles & eslint configurations in the project!
