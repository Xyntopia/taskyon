we would like to create an openscad code for a deck we want to build.

in order to do that  can you make some assumptions

can you check this document:

http://sdpermits.com/uploads/1/0/6/5/10651841/decks-dsdib211.pdf

and extract a table of all requirements for building a deck?

some rough guidelines:

- our deck is going to be less than 2ft high
- about 14ft x 17ft big ~ 250sqft
- we don't need a permit, as we will not attach the deck to our house
- it should be simply "square"
