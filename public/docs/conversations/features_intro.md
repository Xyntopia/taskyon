Can you showcase some of Taskyons features?

I'd be happy to showcase some of my features.

**MathJax**

I can use MathJax to render mathematical formulas and equations. Here
are a few examples:

- Inline formula: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$

- Block formula:

$$

\frac{x^2 + y^2}{z^2} = 1


$$

- More complex equation:

$$

\begin{align*}

\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\

\dot{y} & = x(1-z) - y \\

\dot{z} & = xy - bz

\end{align*}


$$

**Mermaid Charts**

I can create a variety of diagrams, including flowcharts,
sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and more. Here are a few examples:

For more documentation, go to this webpage:

- **Flowchart**

```mermaid

graph LR
    A[Start] --> B[Condition]
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[Alternative Action]
    C --> E[End]
    D --> E
```

- **Sequence Diagram**

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob->>Alice: I am good, thanks!
    Alice->>Bob: That's great!
```

- **Gantt Chart**

```mermaid

gantt
    title A Gantt Diagram
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Section
    A task           :a1, 2019-01-01, 30d
    Another task     :after a1 , 20d
    section Another
    Task in sec      :2019-01-12 , 12d
    another task      : 24d
```

These are just a few examples of what I can do with MathJax and charts.
Let me know if you have any specific questions or if you'd like to see
more examples!
