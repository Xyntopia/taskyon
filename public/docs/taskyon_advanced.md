# Advanced Taskyon Features

- [**what are taskyon trees?**](task_trees): Taskyon organizes its chats & tasks in a tree-like structure. Resembling
  dynamic call graphs from programming languages. The goal of this is to resemble a more targeted approach to
  agents by putting tasks into a hierarchical framework of tasks & subtasks.
- [**Task Transitions**](conversations/taskyon_description): Taskyon tasks are transformed in each step according to specific rules which is described by this document.
- TODO: tools, iframe architecture and more.
