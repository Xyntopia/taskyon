# Taskyon Configuration Documentation

Taskyon is a powerful tool that can be configured to meet the needs of various applications. In this documentation, we will cover the different aspects of Taskyon configuration, including the GUI, iframe integration, and configuration options.

### GUI Configuration

Taskyon provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring its settings. The GUI can be accessed by clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner of the Taskyon window.

The GUI is divided into several sections, each corresponding to a different aspect of Taskyon's configuration. These sections include:

- [**LLM Settings**](https://taskyon.space/settings/agent%20config): This section allows you to configure the Large Language Model (LLM) settings, such as the selected API, task template, and function descriptions.
- [**App Configuration**](https://taskyon.space/settings/app%20config): This section allows you to configure the app settings, such as the app configuration URL, gDrive configuration file, and expert mode.

### Iframe Integration

Taskyon can be integrated into a webpage as an iframe. This allows you to embed Taskyon into your own application and customize its behavior.

To integrate Taskyon into your webpage, you will need to create an iframe element and set its src attribute to the URL of the Taskyon app. You can then use JavaScript to communicate with the Taskyon iframe and customize its behavior.
